# Kinda-Lang Multi-Bot Development Setup Progress

## ‚úÖ Completed Setup (Phase 1 & 2)

### Phase 1: Repository Protection & Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Bot accounts created:** `kinda-lang-coder`, `kinda-lang-reviewer`
- ‚úÖ **Organization created:** `kinda-lang-dev` with both bots as members
- ‚úÖ **Personal Access Tokens generated** for both bot accounts (stored securely)
- ‚úÖ **Branch protection configured** for `main` and `dev` branches:
  - Requires PR reviews (1 reviewer minimum)
  - Requires all CI status checks to pass (15 checks across platforms)
  - Requires conversation resolution
  - No direct commits allowed (even for admins)
  - No force pushes or deletions allowed
- ‚úÖ **Protection verified:** Direct commits are blocked, "Bypass rules" button appears

### Phase 2: Fork Setup & Local Development ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Fork created:** `https://github.com/kinda-lang-dev/kinda-lang`
- ‚úÖ **Fork management scripts created:**
  - `scripts/fork-setup.sh` - Configure local dev environment
  - `scripts/sync-upstream.sh` - Sync fork with upstream changes  
  - `scripts/bot-auth-setup.sh` - Configure git with bot credentials
  - `scripts/ci-full.sh` - Run complete CI locally (matches GitHub Actions)
  - `scripts/env-setup.sh` - Load development environment variables
- ‚úÖ **Local environment configured:**
  - `upstream`: `kmayhew2020/kinda-lang` (protected repo - pull updates)
  - `origin/fork`: `kinda-lang-dev/kinda-lang` (bot workspace - push changes)
  - Currently on `dev` branch, ready for development
- ‚úÖ **Environment variable system:**
  - `.env.local` file for secure PAT storage (git-ignored)
  - `source scripts/env-setup.sh` to load environment

## üîÑ Current Status: Ready for Testing

### Next Steps (Phase 3: End-to-End Testing)
1. **Add PATs to .env.local file:**
   ```bash
   # Edit .env.local and replace with actual PAT values:
   export KINDA_CODER_PAT="ghp_your_actual_coder_pat"
   export KINDA_REVIEWER_PAT="ghp_your_actual_reviewer_pat"
   ```

2. **Load environment and test workflow:**
   ```bash
   source scripts/env-setup.sh
   ./scripts/bot-auth-setup.sh coder
   # Test creating feature branch, making changes, running CI, creating PR
   ```

## üìã How to Resume Development

### Daily Startup Commands:
```bash
cd /home/kevin/kinda-lang-agents
source infrastructure/scripts/bot-setup.sh    # Load bot environment
cd /home/kevin/kinda-lang                     # Switch to main repo
git status                                   # Check current state
```

### Bot Development Workflow:
```bash
# 1. Load bot environment
source /home/kevin/kinda-lang-agents/infrastructure/scripts/bot-setup.sh

# 2. Configure as coder bot  
/home/kevin/kinda-lang-agents/infrastructure/scripts/bot-auth.sh coder

# 3. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/issue-122-record-replay

# 4. Make changes, test locally
/home/kevin/kinda-lang-agents/infrastructure/scripts/ci-local.sh

# 5. Push to fork and create PR
git push origin feature/issue-122-record-replay

# 6. Switch to reviewer bot
/home/kevin/kinda-lang-agents/infrastructure/scripts/bot-auth.sh reviewer
# Review and approve PR on GitHub
```

## üîß Available Scripts

- `scripts/env-setup.sh` - Load development environment
- `scripts/fork-setup.sh` - Initial fork configuration (run once)
- `scripts/sync-upstream.sh` - Sync fork with upstream changes
- `scripts/bot-auth-setup.sh [coder|reviewer]` - Configure git for bot
- `scripts/ci-full.sh` - Complete local CI validation
- `scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh` - Fast pre-commit validation

## üéØ Next Development Target

**Issue #122: Kinda Record/Replay System**
- Final piece of v0.4.0 "Developer Experience Release"
- Enables debugging fuzzy programs with reproducible behavior
- Uses existing `--seed` and `--chaos-level` infrastructure
- Foundation for Epic #124 "Construct Self-definition" validation

## üîê Security Notes

- ‚úÖ `.env.local` is git-ignored (never committed)
- ‚úÖ PATs stored locally only
- ‚úÖ All commits/PRs attributed to proper bot accounts
- ‚úÖ Branch protection prevents accidental direct pushes
- ‚úÖ Separate bot accounts prevent self-approval
