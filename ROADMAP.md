# Kinda Language – Roadmap

## 🔮 Vision

Kinda is a chaotic, satirical meta-layer that injects *fuzzy logic, randomness, and personality* into existing programming languages. Rather than being a new language, Kinda **wraps or modifies code you've already written** in your language of choice — Python, C, Java, etc. — and adds a layer of personality-driven unpredictability.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Write code in your preferred language
- Replace constructs (e.g. `int`, `print`, `if`) with Kinda equivalents (`kinda int`, `sorta print`, `sometimes`)
- Kinda parses your code, augments it with fuzzy logic libraries, and generates a runnable output
- The final result runs like your original program... *sorta*

---

## ✅ Core Principles

- **Inject Chaos:** Bring fuzziness to deterministic code
- **Be Portable:** Work across Mac, Windows, Linux
- **Be Fun:** Embrace satire, weirdness, snarky behavior
- **Be Pluggable:** Allow custom random functions and personalities
- **Be Respectful:** Don’t break CI pipelines, IDEs, or toolchains
- **Be Effortless:** Let users paste in normal code and get "Kinda-fied" results instantly

## 📈 Roadmap

### ✅ MVP Milestones (in progress)
- [x] `kinda int`, `sorta print`, `sometimes`, `maybe` logic
- [x] Basic CLI interface for parsing and augmenting code
- [x] Test mode (low chaos) vs. production mode (max chaos)
- [x] Support for Python augmentation
- [x] Fuzz layer with optional seed for reproducibility

### 🧠 Near-Term Priorities
- [ ] **Personality Profiles**  
  Inject personality-driven behavior into how fuzzy logic is applied (e.g., "chaotic good" vs "passive-aggressive").
- [ ] **C/C++ Augmentation Support**  
  Header injection and macro generation for Kinda-enhanced C code.
- [ ] **Scaffold Generators**  
  Auto-generate helper libraries and hooks for supported languages.
- [ ] **Zero-Effort Mode**  
  Drop in existing code, auto-detect language, replace all supported constructs with Kinda versions.
- [ ] **Statistical Chaos Testing**  
  Analyze variability of outputs over multiple runs.
- [ ] **Golden Path Onboarding**  
  Clear examples, docs, and “Hello, Kinda World” projects for new users.

---

### 🧪 Experimental & Stretch Goals
- [ ] **Personality-Driven Error Messages**
- [ ] **Custom Fuzz Functions via Plugin System**
- [ ] **Multi-language Project Support**  
  Cross-language consistency for shared logic (e.g., Python backend + C frontend).
- [ ] **IDE Extensions / Syntax Highlighting**
- [ ] **"Kinda AI Copilot"** that makes your code *worse* on purpose

---

## 🔍 In Progress

- Python: fuzzy assign, print, and conditional logic
- CLI: parse, transform, and run code with chaos
- GitHub CI: basic unit test harness

---

## 🧵 Threads to Explore

- Should Kinda have its own `.kinda` config file per project?
- What does “personality injection” *actually* affect: randomness, verbosity, logic, variable naming?
- How do we let users *debug* fuzzy behavior while keeping the chaos?

Kinda is chaos. Kinda is community. Join the madness.
