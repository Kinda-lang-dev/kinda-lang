# Kinda-Lang Development Roadmap

## Current Status (2025-08-29)

### ✅ Completed (v0.3.0 RELEASED)
- **All Core Constructs**: `~kinda int`, `~sorta print`, `~sometimes`, `~maybe`, `~ish`, `~kinda binary`, `~welp`
- **CLI Pipeline**: Full `kinda run`, `kinda interpret`, `kinda examples`, `kinda syntax` 
- **Enhanced CLI Error Messages**: Snarky, helpful error guidance with kinda personality
- **Comprehensive Examples**: 12+ examples showcasing all constructs
- **Documentation Infrastructure**: GitHub Pages hosting, updated content, CI/CD
- **CI Pipeline**: Passing on Ubuntu/macOS/Windows, Python 3.8-3.12
- **Test Coverage**: 75% overall coverage achieved

### 🚀 Active Development Roadmap

**v0.4.0 - Enhanced Features & C Transpiler (CURRENT):**
- ✅ **Personality System Integration**: Complete chaos-personality integration (Issue #73) - MERGED
  - 4 personality modes: reliable, cautious, playful, chaotic
  - ALL 9 constructs now personality-aware
  - CLI --mood flag support
  - Cascade failure tracking & instability system
- 🔄 **Enhanced Chaos Constructs**: Time-based drift, cascade failures (Epic #35)
- 🔄 **Documentation Enhancement**: Complex usage patterns, domain examples (Epic #76)
- 🔄 **C Language Support**: Complete C transpiler pipeline (Epic #19)

**v0.5.0 - Advanced Personality & User Experience (PLANNED):**
- 🎭 **10 Personality Modes**: Expand from 4 to 10 distinct personalities (Issue #77)
  - Reliability spectrum: ultra_reliable → reliable → cautious
  - Standard range: playful → mischievous  
  - Chaotic spectrum: chaotic → unpredictable → anarchic
  - Specialized: pessimistic, optimistic personalities
- **Advanced Personality Features**: Custom personalities, personality mixing
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Improved CLI, better error messages

### 📋 Recently Completed Issues (v0.4.0)
- ✅ Issue #73: Chaos-Personality Integration - Complete personality system with 4 modes - MERGED
- ✅ All 9 constructs now personality-aware with --mood flag support
- ✅ Cascade failure tracking and instability system implemented
- 🎭 **Personality System Analysis Complete**: Confirmed dramatic behavioral differences between modes
  - Reliable: High consistency, professional messaging
  - Chaotic: High variance, dismissive messages, extreme fuzzing
  - Playful: Moderate chaos, whimsical messages
  - Cautious: Conservative approach, careful messaging

### 📋 Previously Completed Issues (v0.3.0)
- ✅ Issue #59: ~ish Integration Syntax Fix with ~maybe/~sometimes - CLOSED
- ✅ Issue #63: Documentation Infrastructure and Content Improvements - CLOSED
- ✅ Issue #58: Comprehensive Examples Showcase - All Constructs in Action - CLOSED
- ✅ Issue #56: Enhanced CLI Error Messages with Kinda Personality - CLOSED
- ✅ Issue #41: Test coverage goal achieved (75% target) - CLOSED
- ✅ Issue #38: Complete test coverage for existing constructs - CLOSED

### 🐛 Active Bug Fixes (v0.4.0)
- 🔴 **Issue #79**: Block else syntax (`} {`) doesn't transform correctly - HIGH PRIORITY
- 🟠 **Issue #80**: `~ish` operator doesn't assign result back to variable - MEDIUM PRIORITY  
- 🔴 **Issue #81**: Constructs inside function arguments not transformed - HIGH PRIORITY
- 🟠 **Issue #82**: `~ish` returns value instead of modifying in-place - MEDIUM PRIORITY
- 🔴 **Issue #83**: `~ish` transformer uses wrong function (ish_comparison vs ish_value) - CRITICAL

### 🎯 Current Priorities (v0.4.0)

**Active Development:**
1. **Bug Fixes**: Address transformation issues found during personality testing (Issues #79, #80)
2. **Time-based Variable Drift**: Variables get fuzzier over program lifetime (Issue #74) 
3. **Enhanced Chaos Constructs**: New fuzzy constructs and behaviors (Epic #35)
4. **Documentation Enhancement**: Complex usage patterns, real-world examples (Epic #76)
5. **C Language Support**: Complete C transpiler pipeline (Epic #19)

**Future Planning (v0.5.0):**
6. **10 Personality Expansion**: Expand personality system to 10 distinct modes (Issue #77)

### 💡 Enhancement Ideas from Personality Analysis
- **Personality Intensity Levels**: `--mood chaotic-extreme`, `--mood reliable-strict`
- **Dynamic Personality Shifts**: Personality changes during execution based on success/failure
- **Construct-Specific Tuning**: Different personalities for different constructs
- **Personality Memory**: Recent execution history influences future probability
- **Interactive Personality Modes**: User prompts during execution

**URGENT**: Critical transformer bugs discovered through stress testing must be addressed immediately:
- Issue #83 (ish transformer) and #81 (nested constructs) break core language functionality
- These bugs affect all programs using `~ish` or complex expressions
- **Priority Recommendation**: Fix Issues #79, #81, #83 before continuing Epic #35

### 📊 Stress Testing Results Summary
**Comprehensive testing revealed**:
- ✅ Personality system works perfectly with dramatic behavioral differences
- ✅ CLI `--mood` integration seamless and effective  
- 🚨 5 critical transformer bugs affecting core constructs
- 🎯 Language expressiveness significantly limited by parsing issues
