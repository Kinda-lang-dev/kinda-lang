# Getting Started

Kinda lets you augment existing Python (and eventually other languages) with fuzzy constructs like `kinda int`, `sorta print`, and `sometimes`.

## Installation

```bash
pip install kinda-lang  # hypothetical
```

## Usage

You can write code like this:

```python
kinda int x = 7
sorta print(x)
```

Then run it with:

```bash
kinda run your_file.knda
```
