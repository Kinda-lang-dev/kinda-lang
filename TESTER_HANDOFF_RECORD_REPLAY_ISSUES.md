# 🧪 TESTER AGENT: Record/Replay Test Issues - URGENT

## 🚨 Issue Summary
The CI for PR #129 (v0.4.0 release) is hanging at 64% due to threading deadlocks in the record/replay test suite. As the Tester agent, you need to resolve these test issues to ensure proper coverage of the record/replay system.

## 🔍 Problem Details

### Confirmed Hanging Test
- **File**: `tests/python/test_record_replay_basic.py`
- **Test**: `test_global_recorder_functions`
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Already skipped with proper annotation
- **Root Cause**: Threading deadlock in `get_session_summary()` function

### Additional Suspected Hanging Tests
- **Files**: 
  - `tests/python/test_record_replay_cli.py` 
  - `tests/python/test_record_replay_phase2.py`
- **Status**: ⚠️ **NEEDS INVESTIGATION**
- **Symptoms**: CI timeouts when running these test suites

### Technical Root Cause
The deadlock occurs in the `get_session_summary()` call chain:
1. `get_session_summary()` acquires `_recording_lock` (line 676 in record_replay.py)
2. Calls `_validate_hook_integrity()` which may acquire additional locks
3. Creates deadlock in multi-threaded CI environments (GitHub Actions matrix)

## 🎯 Your Tasks

### 1. **Investigate All Record/Replay Tests** 
```bash
# Test each file individually with timeouts
timeout 30s pytest tests/python/test_record_replay_cli.py -v
timeout 30s pytest tests/python/test_record_replay_phase2.py -v
```

### 2. **Identify Specific Hanging Tests**
- Find which individual test functions hang
- Document the exact function calls that cause deadlocks
- Determine if they all use `get_session_summary()` or similar global functions

### 3. **Choose Resolution Strategy**

**Option A: Fix the Threading Deadlock**
- Simplify the lock hierarchy in `kinda/record_replay.py`
- Remove nested lock acquisitions in validation functions
- Test that the fix doesn't break record/replay functionality

**Option B: Create Alternative Tests**
- Write new tests that avoid the global recorder functions
- Test record/replay functionality through different code paths  
- Ensure equivalent test coverage without the deadlock

**Option C: Mock/Isolate the Problematic Code**
- Mock the `_validate_hook_integrity()` function in tests
- Use dependency injection to avoid global state
- Create unit tests that don't trigger the threading code

### 4. **Validate Test Coverage**
Record/replay is a major v0.4.0 feature. Ensure your solution provides adequate testing of:
- ✅ Basic recording functionality
- ✅ Session file generation and format
- ✅ CLI integration (`kinda record run`)
- ✅ Replay engine functionality
- ✅ Thread safety (if applicable)

## 📊 Current Status
- **Minimal Fix Applied**: `test_global_recorder_functions` is skipped
- **CI Status**: Still hanging (likely other tests have same issue)
- **Coverage Impact**: Record/replay system needs proper test validation

## ⚡ Urgency
This is blocking the v0.4.0 release. Please prioritize and provide a solution that either:
1. **Fixes the deadlock** and restores full test coverage, OR  
2. **Creates equivalent tests** that avoid the threading issues

## 🤝 Coordination
- Report back with your findings on which tests hang
- Coordinate with Architect if the deadlock fix requires design changes
- Hand off to Reviewer once tests are fixed and passing

**Status**: 🔄 **ASSIGNED TO TESTER**
**Priority**: 🔥 **URGENT - RELEASE BLOCKER**
