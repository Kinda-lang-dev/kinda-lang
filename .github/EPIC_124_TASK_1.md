# Epic #124 - Task 1: Core ~sorta Conditional Implementation

## 🎯 Epic Context
**Epic #124: Construct Self-definition** - Build higher-level constructs from basic ones to demonstrate "Kinda builds Kinda" vision.

## 📋 Task Overview
Implement `~sorta` construct using existing basic constructs (`~sometimes`, `~maybe`, personality system) to demonstrate construct composition.

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Implementation
- [ ] Define `~sorta` behavior using composition of existing constructs
- [ ] Integrate with personality system for behavioral variations
- [ ] Implement conditional logic using `~sometimes` + `~maybe` patterns
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing `~sorta` usage

### Implementation Details
```python
# Example target behavior:
def implement_sorta_conditional(condition, action):
    ~sometimes (
        ~maybe (action) if condition else ~rarely (action)
    )
    # Personality influences probability thresholds
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] `~sorta` construct works identically to current implementation
- [ ] Implementation visibly uses `~sometimes`, `~maybe`, and personality
- [ ] All existing `~sorta` tests continue to pass
- [ ] New tests demonstrate composition pattern
- [ ] Clear documentation of how basic constructs combine

## 🧪 Testing Requirements
- [ ] All existing `~sorta` tests pass without modification
- [ ] New tests specifically validate composition behavior
- [ ] Personality integration tests (reliable, chaotic, playful, cautious)
- [ ] Edge case handling (nested conditions, complex expressions)

## 📖 Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Code comments explaining composition pattern
- [ ] Example showing basic constructs being combined
- [ ] Comparison with original `~sorta` implementation

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- [ ] Implementation complete using construct composition
- [ ] All tests passing (existing + new)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Demonstrates "Kinda builds Kinda" principle
