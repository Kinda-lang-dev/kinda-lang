# Epic #124 - Task 2: Framework for Construct Composition Development

## 🎯 Epic Context
**Epic #124: Construct Self-definition** - Build higher-level constructs from basic ones to demonstrate "Kinda builds Kinda" vision.

## 📋 Task Overview
Create infrastructure and framework to support systematic construct composition, enabling meta-programming patterns for building complex behaviors from simpler ones.

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Framework Components
- [ ] **Composition Registry**: Track relationships between basic and composite constructs
- [ ] **Meta-construct API**: Standard interface for defining composite constructs
- [ ] **Dependency Resolution**: Ensure basic constructs are available for composition
- [ ] **Runtime Integration**: Seamless execution of composite constructs

### Framework Architecture
```python
# Example framework structure:
class CompositeConstruct:
    def __init__(self, name, dependencies, composition_logic):
        self.basic_constructs = dependencies  # e.g., ['sometimes', 'maybe']
        self.logic = composition_logic
    
    def execute(self, context):
        # Execute composition using basic constructs
        pass
```

### Implementation Details
- [ ] Design pattern for construct composition
- [ ] Validation system for construct dependencies
- [ ] Error handling for missing basic constructs
- [ ] Performance optimization for composite execution
- [ ] Debugging support for composition chains

## 🧪 Testing Requirements
- [ ] Framework API tests (registration, lookup, execution)
- [ ] Dependency resolution tests
- [ ] Error handling tests (missing dependencies, invalid compositions)
- [ ] Performance tests (composite vs basic construct speed)
- [ ] Integration tests with existing constructs

## 📖 Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Framework architecture documentation
- [ ] API reference for composite construct creation
- [ ] Developer guide for building new compositions
- [ ] Performance characteristics and limitations

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- [ ] Framework supports Task 1 (~sorta) and Task 3 (~ish) implementations
- [ ] Clean API for future construct compositions
- [ ] No performance degradation for basic constructs
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and debugging support
- [ ] Extensible design for future composite constructs

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- [ ] Framework implementation complete
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] API documentation complete
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Ready to support Tasks 3 and 4
