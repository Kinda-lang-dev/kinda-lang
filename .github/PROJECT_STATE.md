# Kinda-Lang Project State

## 🚀 Current Active Development

### **Epic #124: Construct Self-definition** - ✅ **APPROVED & ACTIVE** 
- **Status**: Active Development Phase
- **Start Date**: 2025-09-04
- **Target Completion**: v0.5.0 (~7-9 weeks)
- **Priority**: HIGH (User Core Vision)

#### Task Breakdown:
- **Task 1**: Core ~sorta Conditional Implementation - 🚀 **READY FOR ASSIGNMENT**
- **Task 2**: Framework for Construct Composition Development - ⏳ **PENDING** (depends on Task 1)
- **Task 3**: ~ish Patterns Implementation - ⏳ **PENDING** (depends on Task 2)  
- **Task 4**: Documentation & Examples - ⏳ **PENDING** (depends on Task 3)

### **Key Objectives for Epic #124**
1. **Demonstrate "Kinda builds Kinda"**: Show higher-level constructs built from basic ones
2. **Construct Composition**: Prove language primitives are sufficient for complex behaviors
3. **Meta-programming Validation**: ~sorta from ~sometimes+~maybe, ~ish from ~kinda float+tolerance
4. **Framework Development**: Infrastructure for future construct compositions

## 📊 Development Status

### ✅ Completed Milestones (v0.4.0)
- **All Developer Experience Fundamentals**: 4/4 high-priority DX improvements delivered
  - Issue #121: --chaos-level parameter ✅ 
  - Issue #86: --seed flag ✅
  - Issue #123: ~assert_eventually() statistical testing ✅
  - Issue #122: kinda record/replay system ✅

### 🎯 Current Focus (v0.5.0)
- **Epic #124**: Construct Self-definition (Active)
- **Primary Goal**: Implement construct composition to prove "Kinda builds Kinda" vision
- **Secondary Goal**: Create framework for future composite constructs

### 📋 Next Actions
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Assign Task 1 (Core ~sorta Implementation) to coder agent
2. **Week 1-2**: Complete Task 1 development and testing
3. **Week 3-4**: Complete Task 2 framework development
4. **Week 5-6**: Complete Task 3 ~ish patterns implementation
5. **Week 7-8**: Complete Task 4 documentation and examples
